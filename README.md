# Element-1-Project

## Inspiration
The project was inspired by my favourite video game 'Disco Elysium'.  

When people feel dissatisfied and confused with their current lives, they can still 
count on music. In today's global economic and cultural recession, it gave me a 
disco light ball from the 1970s and 1980s. The outdated disco light ball with its 
old or rock or psychedelic music speaks to the world - instead of worrying about 
tomorrow, one can hopelessly reminisce about the past.  

So, with that in mind, I wanted to create a light ball music player. It may not be 
positive enough, but when the music comes on, swaying along with the ball of 
lights, it comforts the lost souls on a cold winter's day.  

## Presentation
This is an interactive web page that is both aurally and visually rich. In the middle 
of the page is a disco light ball surrounded by coloured lines created using 
three.js. The ball is wrapped in layers but it is hollow - which means it is a nihilist.   
The dark background makes it look like it is floating in the universe.
There are rows of buttons on the side of the page that, when pressed, play great 
music that I have carefully selected. The design is very much like an old-fashioned radio, adding to the retro feel.
I added some interactivity and fun to the project to keep it from being too boring.  
The disco light ball keeps spinning, vast and sad.

## Reflections
The whole project is a little lacking in complexity and depth of code. So that some 
of the effects I was hoping for were not achieved. This was because of the fact 
that I had only been working with code for a short time and my knowledge of 
the subject was not yet complete. I often felt stretched as the project was being 
created. I will try to learn more code to build more complex 3d effects.  
But it plays music with a disco light ball! It's really cool! Isn't it?
